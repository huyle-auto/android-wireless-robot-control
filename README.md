# android-wireless-robot-control

An Android application that replicates the core functionality of traditional industrial robot teach pendants â€” with added flexibility, wireless communication, and modern UI â€” enabling scalable, low-cost deployment and easy updates.

## Overview

This project aims to modernize robot control systems by leveraging the Android ecosystem. Designed as a teach pendant alternative, the app includes all essential features found in conventional robot controllers, while adding:

- **Wireless communication** over **TCP/IP** and **Bluetooth**
- **Customizable interface** and behavior via Android platform
- **Scalable** deployment and update process through standard Android distribution

## Features

- Dual-channel communication (TCP/IP + Bluetooth)
- Jogging and coordinate control
- Program editing and execution
- Local data storage with SQLite
- Responsive UI using Material Design
- Designed for touch-based control tablets and phones

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java
- **Database:** SQLite
- **UI:** Android XML with Material Design Components
- **IDE:** Android Studio

## Testing

Manual testing is currently used to verify key robot control flows, connectivity, and error handling.
